## flask_ac3_project ##
This project implements machine learning(linear regression) to predict if an iris flower species is Setosa, VersiColor, or Virginica. 
A flask app is used to demonstate the findings. You enter in the sepal and petal lengths and the sepal and petal widths. The app will display which species
it predicts. The last part of this project deploys the app in a AWS EC2 instance.
